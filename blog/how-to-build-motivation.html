            <p class="lead">
            It's Christmas Eve. I'm invited to share my entrepreneurial story with 10th-grade students from the Mathematics High School in Kazanlak. Smart kids. Sharp questions. High energy.
            </p>

            <p>
            Instead of giving a classic talk, I decide to flip the dynamic. I ask them a simple question: <b>"What helps you succeed?"</b>
            </p>

            <p>
            At first, there's hesitation. Then hands go up. One by one, they start sharing. Very quickly, the conversation drifts toward motivation - and how they manage to stay motivated every single day.
            </p>

            <p>Here's what they said.</p>

            <h2>"I do what needs to be done."</h2>
            <p>
            About half of the students shared some version of this. They've learned, from a young age, to <b>do what needs to be done</b> - not what feels good in the moment. This is <a href="delayed-gratification">delayed gratification</a> in action.
            </p>

            <p>
            At first, it's pure inertia. Their parents wake up early. Their parents show up. Their parents expect the same from them.
            </p>

            <p>
            Over time, something interesting happens. "Doing what you have to do" becomes part of who you are. <b>You stop negotiating with yourself.</b> You don't ask if you'll study. You ask when.
            </p>

            <p>
            Routines take over. Habits reduce friction. Decisions disappear.
            </p>

            <h2>"I focus on the end result."</h2>
            <p>
            Some students stay motivated by <b>visualizing the finish line</b>. Passing the exam. Winning the competition. Getting accepted.
            </p>

            <p>
            They imagine the relief. The pride. The moment it's finally done. That image carries them through the boring parts.
            </p>

            <h2>"I do it out of spite."</h2>
            <p>
            This one surprised me. More than a few students admitted this openly.
            </p>

            <p>
            Someone tells you: "You can't do it." Something flips. <b>You have to prove them wrong.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
            A bruised ego, it turns out, can be a powerful fuel. Not the healthiest one - but undeniably effective.
            </p>

            <h2>"I need someone to push me."</h2>
            <p>
            Several students talked about moments when they get stuck. Overthinking. Doubting. Going in circles.
            </p>

            <p>
            In those moments, <b>one conversation can change everything</b>. A parent. A friend. A teacher. Someone who says: "Just take the next step."
            </p>

            <p>
            Sometimes that's all it takes.
            </p>

            <h2>From Conversation to Framework</h2>
            <p>
            That conversation stayed with me. So I went back and revisited modern motivation frameworks - Self-Determination Theory, the SDT Continuum, and The Four Forms of Motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
            Then I did what I always do. I simplified them.
            </p>

            <p>
            Here's a practical version - <b>four classes of motivation, from weakest to strongest</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Four Classes of Motivation</h2>

            <h3>A) External Motivation</h3>
            <p>
            This is the most basic form. You act because of <b>rewards or punishments</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying to get a good grade</li>
                <li>Working only for the paycheck</li>
                <li>Going to the gym because your company pays for it</li>
                <li>Doing homework to avoid being yelled at</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            It works - but only while the reward or threat exists. Remove it, and motivation disappears.
            </p>

            <h3>B) Internalized External Motivation</h3>
            <p>
            Here, the pressure moves inside you. You're still reacting - but now it's <b>guilt, fear, or ego</b> doing the pushing.
            </p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying to avoid the shame of failing</li>
                <li>Training hard so you don't disappoint your parents</li>
                <li>Staying late at work because you're afraid of being seen as lazy</li>
                <li>Saying yes to every request because you'd feel guilty saying no</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            You act to avoid bad feelings - or to protect your self-image. It's stronger than pure external motivation, but also exhausting.
            </p>

            <h3>C) Value-Driven Motivation</h3>
            <p>
            This is where things change. The behavior aligns with <b>your values and identity</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
            You don't love the activity itself - but you believe in why you're doing it.
            </p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working to support your family</li>
                <li>Volunteering because being useful matters to you</li>
                <li>Waking up early because you value discipline</li>
                <li>Training daily because being an athlete is part of who you are</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The control shifts inward. You're not forcing yourself anymore - you're choosing. <b>This kind of motivation lasts.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>D) Intrinsic Motivation</h3>
            <p>
            This is the strongest form. You do the thing because <b>the thing itself is rewarding</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
            No pressure. No reward needed. No justification.
            </p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading because you love reading</li>
                <li>Coding because you enjoy solving puzzles</li>
                <li>Training because movement feels good</li>
                <li>Learning something just out of curiosity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Time disappears. Effort feels lighter. <b>This is where creativity, persistence, and mastery thrive.</b>
            </p>

            <h2>The Real Insight</h2>
            <p>
            On my way home that evening, I realized something simple:
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Motivation doesn't start with passion.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
            It starts with showing up. Then with values. And if you're lucky - curiosity follows.
            </p>

            <p>
            The rest is just practice. Even on Christmas Eve.
            </p>
